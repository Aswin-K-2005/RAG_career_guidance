descriptions into numerical vectors. 
o Embeddings capture semantic meaning, enabling similarity-based 
matching. 
4. Vector Indexing 
o FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) indexes the embeddings. 
o Separate indices are created for jobs and courses. 
o Enables millisecond-level retrieval of top matches.
